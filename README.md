# hello-world
Just another hello world project, I guess?

Okay,now a branch has been made.
Yeah,let me try editing it.

Hello, this is me, dndcoc.
(The name is without specific meaning. Just one randomly created by a non-natvie English speaker, who tried really hard to find a username not already taken. There are sooooo many users on this great website.)
Sometimes I wonder how you guys come up with a username, haha.

Well, though several days have past, I'm still reading this one, https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ which, as the web says, require 10 minutes of reading. Hahaha.
